    This is the function that goes and fetches the necessary data to populate the possible choices in dynamic form fields.
    For example, if you have a module to delete a contact, you would need to fetch the list of contacts to populate the dropdown
    and give the user the choice of which contact to delete.

    An action's form may have multiple dynamic form fields, each with their own possible choices. Because of this, in the /content route,
    you will receive a list of content_object_names, which are the identifiers of the dynamic form fields. A /content route may be called for one or more content_object_names.
